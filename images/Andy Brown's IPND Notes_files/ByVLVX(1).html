<!-- Coments help PEOPLE read code. They are ignored by the computer. You should use comments to leave notes for yourself (and anyone else who might read your code later). -->

<!-- The <head> element contains information that won't be displayed on the page. -->

  <!-- The <title> element normally sets the name of the browser tab (but in this example codepen's title overrides the title I set) -->

<!-- The <h1> tag stands for "heading 1". Heading tags go all the way up to <h6>. Lower numbered headings indicate content that is more important. -->
<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.
